# Introduction

This is an example analysis for the 'Robust and Open Analysis in R' Workshop.

We shall be exploring the 'Old Faithful' dataset from Base R. 

#Import and save date

First we import the data from the datasets packages
```{r}
df <- datasets::faithful
```

We can no save this in the 'data' folder as a `csv` for maximum interoptability. 

```{r}
readr::write_csv(x=df, path='data/old_faithful.csv')
```

# Plot marginal distributions

We can plot marginal distributions for each variable.

```{r}
hist(df$eruptions)
hist(df$waiting)
```

We can save them as normal as well:
```{r}
png(filename='images/eruption_density.png')
hist(df$eruptions)
dev.off()
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
